🚀 Diving into #PreppinData Challenge in 2024! 🚀
In 2024, I've taken the plunge into the exciting world of #PreppinData, ready to elevate my data-wrangling skills using Power Query. 📊💻

🔗 Dataset and Requirements: Check out the challenge here: https://lnkd.in/gwBtbbXX

This week's challenge revolves around the Prep Airs Flow Card dataset, and the requirements are intriguing and promising! 🤓💡 Here's a snapshot of the tasks at hand:

1️⃣ Input the Data: Get the dataset on deck and ready for transformation.

2️⃣ Field Splitting: Slice and dice the 'Flight Details' field to extract key information like Date, Flight Number, From, To, Class, and Price.

3️⃣ Data Type Conversion: Ensure accuracy by converting the Date to a standardized date format and Price to a decimal value.

4️⃣ Flow Card Transformation: Change the Flow Card field to user-friendly Yes/No values instead of 1/0.

5️⃣ Table Creation: Form two tables - one for Flow Card holders and another for non-Flow Card holders.

6️⃣ Output the Data Sets: Present structured data with nine key fields for both tables.

I am excited to take on this challenge, learn new techniques, and share the journey with the incredible #PreppinData community! Let's slice, dice, and transform this data into actionable insights! 💪🔍
